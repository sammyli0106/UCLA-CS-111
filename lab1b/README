All the files in the single compressed tarball.
Below are the descriptions of each of the file in there.

1. lab1b-client.c is a program that open a connection to a server through the
   —port=command line rather than sending directly to the shell.

   The program accepts the following command line arguments :

   1) —port=command line : the client should send input from the keyboard 
      to the socket while echoing to the display, and input from the 
      socket to the display.
 
   2) —log=filename : the client maintains a record of data sent over the
      socket. All the data written to or read from the server should be logged
      to the specified file. The log file is being written in a specific format.

   3) —compressed : enable compression of all traffic in both direction.
      The option allow the modification for both the client and server
      applications to compress traffic before sending it over the network
      and decompress it after receiving it.

2. Makefile is a file that build lab1b-client and lab1b-server executable by default. 
   The program is being compiled with the -Wall and -Wextra options.

   1) default ... : The target build the lab1b-client and lab1b-server executable. 
      In order to maximize the compile-time error checking, the program is compiled  
      with the -Wall and -Wextra options.

   2) server ... : The target build the lab1b-server executable alone.
 
   3) client ... : The target build the lab1b-client executable alone.

   4) dist ... : The target builds the distribution tarball.
   
   5) clean ... : The target deletes all files created by Makefile, and 
      return the directory back to the untared state.

3. README is a file that with identification information, a description of the  
   included files, in the check target.
