All the files in the single compressed tarball.
Below are the descriptions of each of the file in there.

1. lab0.c is a program that copies the standard input to standard output by reading
   from file descriptor 0 until the end of the file and write to file descriptor 1.
   If there are no errors being encountered, the programs should exit with a return
   code of 0.

   The program accepts the following command line arguments :

   1) --input=filename : use the specified file as standard input (making it the new fd0).
      If the specified file cannot be opened, then report the error and exit with code 2.

   2) --output=filename : create the specified file and use as standard output (making it the new fd1).
      If the specified file cannot be created, then report the error and exit with code 3.

   3) --segfault : force a segmentation fault. If the argument is specified, then report the error
      immediately and do not copy from stdin to stout.

   4) --catch : use signal to register a SIGSEGV handler that catches the segmentation fault, then logs
      an error message and exit with code 4.

2. Makefile is a file that build the lab0 executable by default. The program is being compiled with
   the -Wall and -Wextra options.

   1) default ... : The target build the lab0 executable. In order to maximize the compile-time error
      checking, the program is compiled with the -Wall and -Wextra options.

   2) check ... : The target runs a set of smoke tests to check whether or not the program
      works, supports the required arguments, and properly report success or failure.

      The set checks included in the smoke-tests are the following :

      programSuccess : The test is repsonsible to create a correctly formated
      input file and a output file. It checks whether the program copy the content
      from the input file to the output file successfully and exit with code 0.

      unrecognArg : The test is try to run the program with a unrecognized argument
      which is not supported in the prorgam. It checks whether the program detect the
      unacceptable argument and exit with code 1.

      badInput : The test is try to run the program with a input file that does not exsists.
      It checks whether the program detects the bad input file and exit with code 2.

      segfaultCatch : The test to check whether the program supports the segfault and catch
      options. 

   3) clean ... : The target deletes all files created by Makefile, and return the directory back
      to the untared state.

   4) dist ... : The target builds the distribution tarball.

3. README is a file that with identification information, a description of the included files,
   the smoke-test cases in the check target.

4. backtrace.png : showing a segfault and associated stack-trace.

5. breakpoint.png : showing a breakpoint and variable inspection.
