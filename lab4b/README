All the files in the single compressed tarball.
Below are the descriptions of each of the file in there.

Files Part : 

1. lab4b.c is a program that uses the AIO functions of the MRAA library to get readings
   from your temperature sensor. It samples a temperature sensor at a configurable rate,
   converts the sensor value into a temperature and creates a report for each sample.
   
   The program accepts the following command line arguments :

   1) -SCALE=F : should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Fahrenheit.

   2) -SCALE=C : should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Centegrade

   3) -PERIOD=seconds : should change the number of seconds between reporting intervals.

   4) -STOP : should cause the program to stop generating reports, but continue processing input commands.

   5) -START : should cause the program to, if stopped, resume generating reports. 

   6) -LOG line of text : This command requires no action beyond logging its receipt 

   7) -OFF : should, like pressing the button, output (and log) a time-stamped SHUTDOWN message and exit.

2. Makefile is a file that build lab4b executable by default. 
   The program is being compiled with the -Wall and -Wextra options.

   1) default ... build your program (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options).

   2) check ... execute an automated smoke-test of your application to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors.

   3) clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile

   4) dist ... (runnable on a Linux desktop or server) create the deliverable tarball

3. README is a file that with identification information, a description of the  
   included files, in the check target.

4. smokeTests.sh contains some test cases to check lab4b.c
