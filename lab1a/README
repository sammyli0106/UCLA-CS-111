All the files in the single compressed tarball.
Below are the descriptions of each of the file in there.

1. lab1a.c is a project that breakes into two major steps.
   The first step is relate to charcater at a time, full duplex terminal I/O.
   The second step is relate to polled I/O and passing input and output between two processes.

   When lab1a.c use without the option --shell, it puts the keyboard into character-at-a-time,
   no-echo mode which is non-canonical input mode with no echo.
   It will map the received <cr> or <lf> into <cr><lf>.
   The received characters are written back out to the display, as they are processed. 

   When lab1a.c use with the option --shell, it passes input/output between the terminal and a shell.
   I need to use fork to craete a new process, then exec a shell whose standard input is a pipe from
   the terminal process, and whose standard output and standard error are a pipe to the terminal
   process. When reading input from the keyboard, echo it to stdout, and forward to the shell.
   <cr> or <lf> will be echo as <cr><lf>, but go to the shell as <lf>.
   When reading the input from the shell pipe, then we write it to stdout.
   If received an <lf> from the shell, it should print as <cr><lf>.

2. Makefile is a file that build the lab1a executable by default. The program is being compiled with
   the -Wall and -Wextra options.

   1) default ... : The target build the lab1a executable. In order to maximize the compile-time
      error checking, the program is compiled with -Wall and -Wextra options.

   2) clean ... : The target deletes all files created by Makefile, and return the directory back
      to the untared state.

   3) dist ... : The target builds the distribution tarball.

3. README is a file that with identification information, a description of the included files.
